I am a Cross-Disciplinary Fellow in Bioinformatics, Genetics, Bayesian Statistics, and Machine Learning at the University of Edinburgh. I completed my undergraduate and master's degrees in theoretical biophysics at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Ukraine. I obtained a PhD in computational biology and probabilistic modeling from the University of Southampton, UK. During my postdoctoral research at the University of Edinburgh and the University of St Andrews, I became interested in how machine learning and bioinformatics can advance genetic research. Currently, my research interests lie at the intersection of evolutionary and population genetics, biomedical data science, genetics of complex traits and translational research.
